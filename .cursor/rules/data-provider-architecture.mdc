## Provider Hierarchy
Location: src/providers/multi_provider.py

Primary data collection system with tiered provider cascade:

1. Direct Google Maps API Provider
- High accuracy, rate limited
- $17 per 1000 requests
- Used for high-priority searches

2. Hybrid Scraper Provider
- Combines geocoding with web scraping
- $5 per 1000 requests
- Used when direct API cost threshold exceeded

3. Pure Scraper Provider 
- Direct web scraping implementation
- Zero cost, rate limited
- Used as final fallback option

## Provider Selection Logic
Location: src/providers/base.py

Intelligent provider routing based on:
- Current API cost totals
- Rate limit status
- Search priority level
- Required data completeness

## Data Normalization Pipeline
Location: src/providers/data_normalizer.py

Business data standardization:
- Company name normalization (remove legal suffixes)
- Address standardization
- Phone number formatting
- Website URL canonicalization
- Email extraction and validation

## Cost Management System
Location: src/providers/cost_tracker.py

Provider cost optimization:
- Real-time cost tracking per provider
- Automatic provider switching at cost thresholds
- Cost-based rate limiting
- Usage reporting and forecasting

## Fallback Chain Management
Location: src/providers/fallback_manager.py

Cascading provider system:
- Success rate monitoring
- Automatic provider switching on failure
- Data quality validation
- Minimum data completeness enforcement
