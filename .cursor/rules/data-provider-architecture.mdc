# data-provider-architecture

The data provider architecture implements a sophisticated multi-source business data collection system with intelligent fallback mechanisms and cost optimization:

## Provider Cascade System
- Primary: Google Maps Places API 
- Secondary: Hybrid Scraper (combines Geocoding + web scraping)
- Tertiary: Pure Scraper implementation
- Final Fallback: OpenStreetMap free data

Implementation paths:
```
src/providers/
  ├── multi_provider.py      # Provider orchestration logic
  ├── google_places_new.py   # Primary Google Maps integration
  ├── hybrid_scraper.py      # Combined API + scraping approach
  ├── pure_scraper.py        # Web-only scraping implementation
  └── openstreetmap_provider.py  # Free data fallback
```

## Provider Selection Logic
1. Cost-Based Routing:
- Tracks API usage across providers
- Routes requests to lower-cost providers when possible
- Maintains quality thresholds for provider selection
- Implements smart caching to minimize API calls

2. Geographic Coverage Rules:
- US locations: Prefers Google Maps + YellowPages
- International: Falls back to OpenStreetMap
- Metro areas: Uses hybrid approach for better coverage
- Rural areas: Combines multiple providers for validation

3. Quality Assurance:
- Cross-validates data between providers
- Implements provider-specific field normalization
- Handles inconsistent address formats
- Deduplicates business records across sources

## Business Rules

1. Provider Priority Scoring:
```
Google Maps: 100 points (baseline)
- Minus 10 points per $0.01 cost
- Minus 5 points per second of latency
- Plus 20 points for data freshness

Hybrid Scraper: 80 points
- Plus 10 points for cost savings
- Minus 15 points for potential blocking
- Plus 5 points per successful cache hit

Pure Scraper: 60 points
- Plus 20 points for zero API costs
- Minus 25 points for reliability concerns
- Plus 15 points for data completeness
```

2. Fallback Triggers:
- API quota exhaustion
- Rate limiting detection
- Quality threshold failures
- Coverage gaps in target area
- Cost optimization targets

3. Data Quality Requirements:
- Business name match score > 85%
- Address components validation
- Phone number format verification
- Category mapping confidence > 90%
- Operating hours completeness check

Importance Score: 90/100 (Critical business logic for data acquisition)
