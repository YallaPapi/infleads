- Disposable domain detection

Scoring system:
- Valid emails: +20 points to lead score
- Catch-all domains: +10 points

Email verification results affect overall lead scoring:
- Valid business emails boost total score
- Invalid emails may disqualify leads
- Domain quality factors into scoring
- Custom scoring rules per industry vertical

### Caching & Rate Limiting

- 24-hour verification result caching
- Provider-specific rate limiting:
  * MailTester.ninja: 100/minute
  * SMTP checks: 50/minute
  * MX lookups: 200/minute
- Automatic token refresh (23-hour window)
- Result persistence across verification runs

### Industry-Specific Rules
