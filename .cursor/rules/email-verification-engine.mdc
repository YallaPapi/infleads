Email Verification Pipeline
Importance Score: 85/100

Core Components:

1. Multi-Stage Verification System (`src/email_verifier.py`)
- Pattern-based validation for syntax and format
- MX record verification with custom DNS timeout handling
- SMTP connection testing with bounce prediction
- Disposable email detection using pattern database
- Custom scoring based on verification results (0-100)

2. Verification Result Classification
- Valid (Score 80-100): Fully verified working address
- Risky (Score 50-79): Passed syntax but failed SMTP
- Invalid (Score 0-49): Failed basic validation or blacklisted
- Unknown (Score -1): Verification timeout or error

3. Scoring Rules
- Basic syntax check: +20 points
- Valid domain with MX: +30 points
- SMTP verification: +50 points
- Penalties:
  - Disposable domain: -40 points
  - Role account (info@, sales@): -20 points
  - Generic local part: -10 points
  - Historical bounce rate: -5 to -25 points

4. Caching Strategy
- TTL-based cache for verification results
- Domain-level MX caching
- Negative result caching with shorter TTL
- Provider-specific timeout configurations

5. Provider Integration
- Primary verification through direct SMTP
- Fallback to third-party verification services
- Results aggregation with weighted scoring
- Custom timeout handling per provider

Business Rules:
- Minimum score of 70 required for campaign inclusion
- Auto-retry failed verifications after 24 hours
- Maximum 3 verification attempts per address
- Domain-level verification rate limiting
- Blacklist/whitelist domain override system
