## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


TaskMaster Enterprise System implements a sophisticated task orchestration and management platform with several key business components:

1. Task Intelligence Core
- Custom complexity scoring (1-10) based on technical depth, integration points, and risk factors
- Smart dependency inference and validation 
- Multi-context task isolation with state preservation
- Automated task progression based on code changes
- Intelligent subtask generation and breakdown

2. Parameter Management System
- Field-level schema mapping with smart defaults
- Round-trip validation and transformation engine
- Automated data normalization between task contexts
- Version-aware schema drift detection

3. Orchestration Engine
- Multi-agent task delegation and coordination
- Context-aware workflow optimization
- Parallel execution planning with dependency resolution
- State machine for task lifecycle management
- Branch-aware task organization

4. Hook System
- Git commit task state management
- Test success task completion detection 
- PR readiness validation
- Dependency-based progression rules
- Daily standup report generation

5. Project Analysis 
- Task complexity pattern recognition
- Implementation path optimization
- Test coverage requirement analysis
- Technical debt risk scoring
- Resource allocation suggestions

The system provides enterprise-grade task management with emphasis on intelligent automation, complexity analysis, and workflow optimization. Core value derives from AI-assisted task breakdown and automated progression based on actual development activities.

Key Integrations:
- Version Control: Task state management via commits
- CI/CD: Test-driven task completion
- Documentation: Auto-synced README updates
- IDE: Development context awareness

The platform implements sophisticated business rules around task dependencies, complexity scoring, and automated progression while maintaining strict isolation between different task contexts.
