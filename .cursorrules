Email Verification Scoring System (Importance: 85/100)
- Multi-stage verification pipeline that assigns quality scores to extracted email addresses
- Industry-specific scoring weights based on business vertical
- Campaign-based verification rules with customizable thresholds

Core Verification Components:
1. Email Validation Pipeline:
- Domain reputation analysis with provider-specific scoring
- MX record validation with weighted scoring
- Secondary email pattern verification against common business formats
- Multi-source email confirmation across data providers

2. Quality Scoring Algorithm:
- Base domain score (0-40 points)
  - Active MX records: 15 points
  - Domain age: 0-10 points
  - SSL certificate: 5 points
  - Business email hosting: 10 points
- Pattern matching score (0-30 points)
  - Standard business format: 15 points
  - Named recipient match: 10 points
  - Role-based deduction: -5 points
- Provider verification score (0-30 points)
  - Cross-provider confirmation: 15 points
  - Yellow Pages verification: 10 points
  - Google Business Profile match: 5 points

3. Campaign Qualification Rules:
- Minimum required score varies by industry:
  - Financial Services: 80+
  - Healthcare: 75+
  - Retail: 65+
  - General Business: 60+
- Additional verification requirements for regulated industries
- Automatic campaign exclusion for scores below threshold

4. Caching Strategy:
- 7-day cache for verified emails scoring 80+
- 3-day cache for scores 60-79
- No caching for scores below 60
- Immediate cache invalidation on bounce reports

The engine maintains separate verification rules and scoring thresholds for each business vertical while implementing a unified caching strategy to optimize verification performance across campaigns.
