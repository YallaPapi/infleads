# InfLeads Error Fixes - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Fix critical errors and warnings in the InfLeads application that were identified after the recent GitHub pull. The application is currently running but has several issues that need immediate attention.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Python Syntax Warning
**Issue**: Invalid escape sequence '\d' in `src/lead_enrichment.py:239`
**Impact**: SyntaxWarning that could become an error in future Python versions
**Priority**: High
**Location**: `src/lead_enrichment.py` line 239

### 2. Code Quality Issues
**Issue**: Need to review and fix any other regex patterns that may have similar escape sequence problems
**Impact**: Potential runtime errors and code maintainability
**Priority**: Medium

### 3. Error Handling Review
**Issue**: Review error handling throughout the application after recent updates
**Impact**: Application stability and user experience
**Priority**: Medium

## Technical Requirements

### Fix Regex Escape Sequences
- Fix the invalid escape sequence in lead_enrichment.py
- Scan entire codebase for similar regex patterns
- Use raw strings (r'') or proper escaping for all regex patterns
- Test all regex patterns to ensure they work correctly

### Code Quality Improvements
- Run static analysis to identify other potential issues
- Fix any import errors or missing dependencies
- Ensure all new code from the GitHub pull is properly integrated
- Test critical functionality to ensure it works

### Error Handling Enhancement
- Review error handling in all modified files
- Add proper exception handling where missing
- Ensure graceful degradation when external services fail
- Add logging for better debugging

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have
1. All SyntaxWarnings are eliminated
2. Application runs without any Python warnings
3. Critical functionality (lead generation, data processing) works correctly
4. All regex patterns use proper escaping

### Should Have
1. Improved error handling throughout the application
2. Better logging for debugging
3. Code quality improvements identified by static analysis

### Nice to Have
1. Performance optimizations
2. Code documentation updates
3. Unit tests for fixed functionality

## Success Metrics
- Zero Python warnings when running the application
- All critical user workflows function correctly
- No runtime errors during normal operation
- Improved code maintainability score

## Timeline
- Immediate: Fix critical syntax warnings
- Within 1 hour: Complete all error fixes and testing
- Follow-up: Code quality improvements and enhanced error handling

## Dependencies
- Access to the codebase
- Python development environment
- Testing capabilities

## Risk Assessment
- Low risk: Syntax fixes are straightforward
- Medium risk: Ensuring all functionality still works after fixes
- Mitigation: Thorough testing of all modified components
