## Lead Scoring Rules (R27)

The AI scores leads from 0-10 based on:
- **+3 points**: No website or broken website
- **+2 points**: Low review rating (<3.5 stars)
- **+2 points**: Less than 3 images
- **+2 points**: No social media presence
- **+1 point**: Unclaimed Google Business listing

Higher scores = Better leads (more need for digital marketing services)
