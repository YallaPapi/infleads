# MultiProvider and Provider Integration Fixes

## Overview
Fixed critical issues in the MultiProvider and provider integration system to ensure proper handling of different query formats and consistent metadata management.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Query Format Handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent query parsing across providers
- MultiProvider passed full query to sub-providers, but each provider parsed differently
- Some providers expected "restaurants in New York", others needed separate parameters
- Location information was sometimes lost in the transformation

**Solution**: 
- Standardized query parsing in MultiProvider
- Added query validation with detailed logging
- Each provider now handles the original query consistently
- Added proper fallback handling for queries without location

### 2. Metadata Consistency
**Problem**: Inconsistent metadata across results from different providers
- `search_keyword` and `search_location` fields were set differently
- Some providers didn't set these fields at all
- Results from different providers had inconsistent data structure

**Solution**:
- MultiProvider now ensures all results have consistent metadata
- Added override logic to standardize `search_keyword`, `search_location`, and `full_query`
- Each provider now sets proper metadata in its results

### 3. Logging and Debugging
**Problem**: Insufficient logging made debugging difficult
- No visibility into query transformations
- Hard to track which provider contributed which results
- Limited error information when providers failed

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the pipeline
- Query validation with format detection and issue reporting
- Debug logging for query transformations and result processing
- Enhanced error logging with more context

### 4. Base Provider Improvements
**Problem**: Base provider had pandas dependency issue
**Solution**: Fixed pandas import to be optional with graceful fallback

## Files Modified

### `src/providers/multi_provider.py`
- Added `_validate_query_format()` method for query validation
- Enhanced `fetch_places()` with query validation and better logging
- Improved metadata consistency across all results
- Added debug logging for provider calls and result processing

### `src/providers/openstreetmap_provider.py`
- Added consistent logging for query processing
- Enhanced metadata setting for all results
- Improved query parsing debug information

### `src/providers/hybrid_scraper.py`
- Added query extraction methods: `_extract_keyword_from_query()` and `_extract_location_from_query()`
- Ensured all results have proper metadata
- Added logging for result counts and processing

### `src/providers/pure_scraper.py`
- Added query extraction methods for consistent keyword/location parsing
- Ensured metadata consistency across all results
- Enhanced logging for debugging

### `src/providers/base.py`
- Fixed pandas dependency to be optional with graceful fallback
- Improved `normalize_field()` method reliability

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script: `tests/test_provider_integration.py`

### Test Results
All query formats now work correctly:
- ✅ `"restaurants in New York"` - Combined format with location
- ✅ `"dentists in Miami"` - Combined format with location  
- ✅ `"coffee shops"` - Keyword only (warns about missing location)
- ✅ `"lawyers in Las Vegas"` - Combined format with location
- ✅ `""` - Empty query (handled gracefully with validation errors)
- ✅ `"   "` - Whitespace query (handled gracefully with validation errors)

### Query Validation Features
- **Format Detection**: Automatically detects combined vs keyword-only formats
- **Validation**: Identifies empty queries, malformed formats, missing components
- **Issue Reporting**: Provides specific warnings for query issues
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Key Improvements

1. **Consistent Query Handling**: All providers now handle both "restaurants in New York" and separate query/location formats properly

2. **Preserved Location Information**: Location data is now consistently preserved and passed to all sub-providers

3. **Enhanced Logging**: Full visibility into query transformations, provider calls, and result processing

4. **Robust Error Handling**: Better error messages and graceful degradation when providers fail

5. **Metadata Standardization**: All results now have consistent metadata regardless of source provider

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: System now handles all query formats consistently
- **Debuggability**: Comprehensive logging makes issues easy to identify and fix
- **Maintainability**: Standardized interfaces and consistent behavior across providers
- **User Experience**: Better results with proper metadata for all formats
- **Cost Protection**: Maintains the free provider system while improving functionality

## Usage Examples

```python
from providers.multi_provider import MultiProvider

provider = MultiProvider()

# Both formats work identically now
results1 = provider.fetch_places("restaurants in New York", limit=10)
results2 = provider.fetch_places("dentists in Miami", limit=10) 

# All results have consistent metadata:
for result in results1:
    print(f"Name: {result['name']}")
    print(f"Keyword: {result['search_keyword']}")
    print(f"Location: {result['search_location']}")
    print(f"Source: {result['source']}")
```

## Next Steps

The provider integration system is now robust and ready for production use. All query formats are handled consistently with proper logging and error handling.
