this is how to make money with the model context protocol or MCP for short which you should learn about if you want to know how to take advantage of AI fully in the coming weeks to months because if you just look at Google Trends you can see that MCP has already exceeded the combined search demand of other trending topics in AI and I myself went through more than 300 MCP servers and consumed and read hours worth of content on MCP in order to teach you the top three ways that you can make money with MCP right now as well as a full downloadable
workflow that implements these MCP methods in a way that's simple to understand and what's great is since we are using no code tools anyone can do it and anyone can understand it even if you're a complete beginner all you literally just need to know is how to drag and drop things and you're set and this video will also use the least amount of jargon to make sure that even if you're non-technical you can understand what we are doing and last but not least if you are watching this that means that you are still quite
early because if we go back to Google Trends you can see that people who know about MCP is still very small compared to those who know about AI's most popular tool Chat GPT which means that if you invest some time today to watch till the end you may just learn the most valuable skill in AI before anyone [Music] else by the way if you're new here my name is Jay and it is my sole mission to make AI easy to learn for anyone who wants to especially if you want to start earning from this wave and in fact to
make this as easy as possible I've collected all the resources and prompts you need for this lesson in this page in our community with a specific call out for this blueprint file which you can just download and import to the tool that we will be using and it will create that automation workflow for you without even having to lift a finger all right let's dip into this so the framework of what we'll learn is actually very simple because before we can understand how to make money with MCP we first need to understand what MCP is in the first
place so we'll be explaining it in the simplest way possible but first let's do a recap because for you to understand what MCP is you first need to understand what an AI agent is and very simply if you think about a chatbot like ChatGpt what it basically allows you to do is it gives you the actions that you need to do while an AI agent does the actions for you so let's say if you want to order a burger from McDonald's you put that into chat GPT it will basically direct you to McDonald's.com to order it can't really do the ordering for you but
an AI agent which is coming up in a few months to years if you ask it to order a burger from McDonald's then it will probably ask you to confirm your order and then we'll proceed to buy it if you want and to take another example which can be set up right now if you want to send an email and you ask Chachi PT to do that it will probably give you a draft of that email to copy paste to Gmail but an AI agent goes beyond that and actually sends the email for you but there is a huge problem with AI agents right now and that is simply the fact that it is quite difficult to set up an
AI agent because every action that they can take needs to be set up separately so if we imagine our AI agent to have their own computer or tablet where they do all of their tasks and actions if you were the AI agent you would prefer to just have one Gmail app in your computer right but the problem right now is each and every action that they can take there is a separate app for it so imagine if in your own computer you need to open up a separate app to be able to read mails to be able to send mails and so on and so forth it would be quite
confusing and so it would be for your AI agent as well which is obviously not ideal but the thing is that is actually how it's set up right now so if you take for example an N8N which is one of the popular AI agent builder softwares out there that is exactly how it's set up so you would have a different node for sending emails via Gmail for replying to emails for creating drafts and so on and you who is the AI agent builder would also need to set this up one by one and if you unpack each of those nodes these are direct screenshots from N8N and you
can see that each action they all have different formats and different attributes that you would need to set up which is not ideal for yourself as the builder and for the AI agent given the variety of actions that they need to take so the value ad that MCP does is that it takes the AI agent setup from this to something closer to this where you basically centralize all of the actions that a certain application does in this case Gmail into one single node which is obviously good news for your AI agent because now it is much simpler so that's well and good but uh how does MCP
actually do that well the short of it is that MCP sets a protocol that applications need to follow so AI agents can understand those applications or in other words each app needs to provide their MCP recipe book for AI agents to use because if you think about a recipe book that obviously has recipe pages inside of it and each of those recipes would have a description of what that dish is about what are the ingredients that you as the chef should bring into the table so that you can create that dish and a specific set of instructions which you can execute to get to the
final product and so it's the same with an application's MCP server so an MCP server for example Gmails is basically going to be a recipe book where each page corresponds to a tool or action for example there may be a tool or action around checking unread emails that's named as this and obviously there's a couple more that you can do with Gmail but each of those tools or actions would have a description which is important because this is being fed to the AI agent as well so that they can understand what this tool really does each tool will also have a set of
parameters or ingredients that the AI agent will need to bring to the table in order to use this action so for example the agent would need to define who's the sender or when's the date of the unread emails that it's looking for which is quite common if you have done it yourself and have searched through your mail and each tool will also have a package which is going to be a set of instructions on how to execute that tool and usually that package is going to be a piece of code which you don't need to
know about as the agent or as the user because in this case for example it's a piece of code that is stored in Google's servers or computers somewhere in the US and your agent just needs to click a button to call on that set of instructions by typing a piece of text such as this so that's basically MCP in a nutshell it's like a recipe book that gives instructions to the chef or put in other words it's basically a protocol that gives context to the AI model which is also why it's called MCP or model context protocol in short but there is another big question right because yes we talked about let's say Gmail having
an MCP but does that mean every application will have an MCP and who even makes them in the first place well the thing is if you just type MCP in Google search you'll see that it's only the past few months really that it has taken off which is not surprising because it was first launched sometime in November but despite that there are actually more than 3,000 MCP servers already available in the market and they are mostly done by the open- source community so it's basically people like you and me who are doing this out of their own interest and are creating MCP
servers for Gmail for Microsoft Teams and literally 3,000 other applications all done by the open-source community and that's important to understand because that's actually a key point into understanding how to make money with MCP because if we look at history it doesn't repeat itself but it often rhymes and usually what happens in history is that when people start using this new thing businesses would need a way to be present in that thing so to make that more real let's take one business for example let's say McDonald's which we
know has been around for decades even before the internet became a thing right but in the '90s when people started using the internet McDonald's needed a website to be present in the internet because that's where people are and the method by which they created a website needed to adhere to something called TCP which is short for transmission control protocol which we won't get into but it's basically a way to standardize the creation of websites similar to how MCP is now and then somewhere in the 2000s when people started using smartphones
McDonald's also needed an app to be present in smartphones because how else would you order your cheeseburger if not through a smartphone app and the protocols that McDonald's needed to adhere to is of course iOS for Apple and Android for everything else because those are the only ways by which you can be present in people's smartphones and so similarly now in the 2020s when people start using AI agents to do their tasks for them McDonald's may also need an MCP server to be present for those agents because how else can an AI agent
connect to McDonald's to order a cheeseburger for their human right and the protocol that seems to be most likely in creating these MCP apps would be the model context protocol itself and obviously this is going into the predictive territory but let's say if chat GPT or OpenAI goes allin in enabling AI agent capabilities for their app maybe in the future you can open your chat GPT app and install different MCP apps in there that will basically allow chat GPT to connect to McDonald's to connect to different services so that chat GPT as your AI agent can actually do those tasks for you and from recent
news it does seem that open AAI is actually supporting the model context protocol which points to the fact that it is very likely that the MCP is going to be adopted as a way for AI agents to interact with different apps and this is a big thing that OpenAI supports it because MCP was actually launched by their main competitor Antropic sometime in November so the fact that the two biggest players in AI Open AI and Entropic are supporting it points to brighter futures for MCP as a skill to learn if you want to get ahead in the AI space so there very quick very simple explanation of MCP if you want to get
more info there you can just talk to Chad GPT and ask more technical questions but in a nutshell that's what you need to understand so that we can get on with our main topic which is how to make money with MCP and there are basically three paths that you can take as of right now and they range in difficulty as well from things that are hard to to things that are easiest which we will actually get into a demo in just a bit and the first of these paths is to create the MCP app store which is actually talked about in more detail by this great podcast from Greg Eisenberg
when he interviewed Professor Ross Mike about MCP and what's great about this interview is that Professor Rasmite actually built a mockup of an MCP app store which you can go to by just going to mcpappstore.com and the idea for it is similar to any app store that you can think of where it just shows the different set of MCP apps and if you do an install then you'll be able to use that tool for your AI agent now obviously the reason why we put that in the difficult bucket is because we don't know yet exactly how people will find their MCP apps so it may be too early to
dive into that space it's possible that because Chad GPT is the one that people use so much right now so that app store idea may be monopolized by them but it's too early to tell which is why I think it's in the harder part of the difficulty spectrum here but obviously if you have an app store then of course there is an opportunity to create MCP apps and as we have talked about earlier it's possible for you to create it for some incumbents so the McDonald's of the world will obviously need developers still to create these MCP servers for them and so having that skill in the
next few years is going to be crucial if you want to cater to this market or you can also create entirely new apps for AI agents similar to how let's say Uber or Airbnb became so big when smartphones became a thing so what are those versions of services that people would want their AI agents to be able to have access to or do and the best place to learn right now on how to create these MCP servers is of course the model context protocols official documentation which we have linked also in our community and you can refer to these
different SDKs or software development kits and it's also available in different coding languages so if you're comfortable with Python let's say then you can start with that now obviously documentations like this is more in the space of developers who have experience in this platform so it's still a bit difficult to get into right now but since chat GPT and other language models can actually help even a non-developer start building then this may be a good time to invest some hours to learn these SDKs in order to get you prepared for
this space but there the second path is for you to create MCP apps which may still not be so accessible for some people so the easiest and the one that we will be going through today is the third path which is how you can create an AI agent that is using MCP and what we will be doing is to build out this AI agent step by step and show you how you can use MCP to power the agent itself so it's going to be what I'm calling an infinite leads AI agent that is powered by Google Maps MCP and its purpose simply put is to automatically collect leads from Google Maps use AI to analyze each one and generate a lead score for
it which is basically going to be a measure of how ready they are to accept our services and also create a personalized email based on the service that's best for them using the data that we are gathering from Google Maps and just to demonstrate how it works it's an agent that you can talk to so for example if I ask it to give me five restaurants in Sydney what it will do is activate the agent extract some information from Google Maps using our MCP connection and you can see once it's finished processing it has provided me those restaurants which you can see you
can actually freely explore those five restaurants in Google Maps if you want a more visual representation but the most important for us in this case is this CSV file which if we open will show you a lot of relevant information around what those restaurants are and their address their contact details and social media channels which you can use to reach out to them and most importantly these columns that our AI agent created where it basically assigned a lead score as well as a reasoning behind that score so for example this lead in particular
is assessed to be a good business to offer a service to because it doesn't have a website yet it doesn't have good social media presence yet and there's a high percentage of one-star reviews so most likely they will need some help to manage all of that and you can see if you just read through these what the different aspects are that are being analyzed by the agent and we'll go through each of those later in full and what's also good is that it creates a draft email for you which you can just feed into another automation for you to be able to send it to the client of your
choice and each of these emails are customized as well based on the lead score reasoning so you can see if you expand that this basically talks through that this establishment can probably optimize their review management and visual content because our agent was able to identify that they don't have a lot of images or website and their reviews are mostly one to two stars and that's actually a pretty simple workflow to set up and it's something that you can sell as a service to businesses who are trying to find leads or maybe you can use the leads yourself if you are running an agency yourself and the tool
that we will be using to build this AI agent is called N8N which if you don't know what N8N is it's basically a noode automation builder quite similar to Zapier or make.com but you can see in Google Trends that it has risen in popularity quite recently because of how flexible and easy it is to make AI agents from within this tool and to build out the agent we will basically have two steps to the process we will first set up our self-hosting to N8N then we will build the actual workflow and just to quickly explain what this self-hosting means usually when you
start using N8N you do it via signing up to their website called N8N.io and this is actually the cloud instance of N8N so the automation workflows that you create are being stored and managed by N8N the company itself meanwhile if you self-host N8N then your workflows are basically going to be stored by yourself in the computer or the server of your choice and just to do a quick comparison the reason why we will be self-hosting in this instance is simply because at the time of recording the cloud N8N doesn't have access to MCP
yet while the self-hosted version does and also there are a few benefits to it such as the cost so in cloud N8N the lowest price tier is something like 27 USD per month while when you do the self-hosted version it can be as low as $5 a month or even less if you have your own custom personal setup that said it does take a few extra steps to set up but if you follow along then you'll be able to try out self-hosting N8N in the easiest way possible and the tool that we will be using to self-host is called railway.com so if you just click on that link at our community it will take you
to Railway's homepage where you can just sign up and just to quickly step back Railway is basically a service when you can hire servers or computers for rent and the computers that they use run 24 hours a day seven days a week which is basically what you need for self-hosting a service like N8N and the great thing about them is how simple everything is to set up first you need to sign in and make an account with Railway so just click on sign in and click continue with GitHub and if in case you don't have a GitHub account just go ahead and create an account here and once that's done you
can click sign in and authorize Railway app and the reason why Railway uses GitHub is simply because GitHub is one of the most common ways by which developers and people in the tech world share resources to each other so now you can just accept the terms and conditions of Railway as well as their fair use policy feel free to read through that as intended and now it will direct you to create a new project which you can just click on deploy a template and go ahead and search N8N and you can see there's several options here but the template that's most popular and most reliable
would be this N8N with workers so go ahead and click that and you can see that these are ready to be deployed so just click deploy and if in case you encounter an error it's likely because Railway has started implementing limited trials at this point so you will just need to upgrade your plan to the hobbyest tier which is only $5 a month so that should be accessible for most people so once you've subscribed and you have the hobby plan already just go to railway.com/dashboard click again on new and now if you deploy N8N with workers that same template so just go ahead and
wait for it to finish and once it's successful you should have this activity log that says successful on all of those four deployments so feel free to maybe screenshot this and paste it to chat GPT if you want to understand some of these other workers here but the key piece that we need is this primary node which if you just click on that it will provide you this link which you can see is being hosted by railway themselves and if you click on that there you go you now have your self-hosted version of N8N so similar to N8N you just need to create your own account here so go ahead
and sign up to that then click next and once you get your account set up just click on get started and this is an option for you to get some paid features for free so you can enable that if you wish by sending yourself a free license key and there you go you are set and you can now create your very first workflow in your self-hosted N8N instance so now that you've done the self-hosting in N8N it is time to build the workflow itself and to do that you just need to click on create workflow here at the top right and then name this workflow with whatever is appropriate and just click
on add first step and this first step is always going to be a trigger so if you just search for chat you'll be able to select the chat trigger and just click away for now and that basically allows you to chat to your AI agent which we can set up in the succeeding step so just click on plus search for AI agent and click on that and before we go any further if it's your first time using N8N it's probably a good idea to just step back to explain the design of working in N8N because every node in N8N is actually configured the same way
there's basically three sections when you open each node up and the one at the left is the input section which is basically attributes that are coming from all the nodes at the left that precedes the node that you are configuring this green section would be the configurations basically what you want your node to be doing and then this section at the right would be the output area which shows the values that it will be passing along to the succeeding nodes so you can see here in our AI agent node it is working pretty much the same and
obviously the input will be a chat message in this case so there's no info there yet but to set this up just make sure that this is set to connected chat trigger node and it will automatically get the chat input that we can try out in a bit so once that's done just click away and you can see there are a couple of subbranches here which you need to set up and the one in asterisk is the chat model so that is the one that is required so just click on that and you can use anything here that you want you can see they're all language models like DeepSeek OpenAI and Google Gemini for
the purpose of this tutorial a good service that is actually good to learn as well is this Open Router chat model so just click on that i linked the URL for Open Router here you can see it's basically a service where you can switch between language models quite easily so I found that it is a nifted tool to learn so just go ahead and sign up here and to set up the open router chat model in N8N basically you will need a credential to connect with so just click on that click on create new credential and you can see that it is requesting for an API key so if you go back to open
router and once you've signed up just head to settings and click on API keys here on the left and just go ahead and click on create key give it a name and there you go so you now have your new key which you can copy and paste into this field so click on save and there you can see the connection has tested successfully and by the way this API key is also acting like a password so don't give it away for myself for example I'll just be deleting them after this tutorial and what's great about Open Router is that with that credential connected you can actually see that you
can just switch between models quite easily here and if you just search on free then you can find several models here that are free to use without incurring any cost which is always good so feel free to try that out in your own time but for this tutorial I suggest to use GPT40 because that provides the best results for what we are about to do and now you can see that this has been properly set up without any reds or errors and just click on save so now if you click on open chat you can see it brings up this chat window where if I
just talk to my AI agent you can see it uses GPT40 to reply back to us with a proper hello so now if we look at our end in my workflow you can see that the next thing we need to set up is our MCP connection to Google Maps and for us to use MCP in N8N we actually need to install the node for it so if you just click this link in our community that will take you to this GitHub page which is basically just documentation around the community node itself but the way to install it is quite simple because if you just click
on this ellipses and click on settings in a new tab and go to community nodes here in the left click on install a community node and copy this piece of text in our community page and paste that here click on this checkbox and click on install and there you go you successfully installed the N8N MCP node so now if we go back to our workflow and do a right click and click on add node if you type in MCP you should be able to find this MCP client along with this box icon at the right which tells you that it is a node from the open source community so just click on that and for
this example let's use the list available tools action so just click here so when you did that you can see that it just created this MCP list tools client which we will just use to illustrate how MCP works so just double click there and rename it to something like MCP list tools tester and to set this up just click on create new credential and you can see that it is asking for a couple things here command arguments and environments so what are those well if you go back to our analogy from a while ago this is basically the part where you provide the
ingredients descriptions and instructions to your AI agent through the MCP recipe book and in our community if you just go to this MCP servers lists this is basically going to give you a few directories of where to find those recipe books so this one is the most popular so let's look at that first and this is quite a long document but you can see there are links here to 300 plus applications which your AI agent can connect to via MCP which is quite neat because there's so many options that you can do and in fact if you go to this URL in our community called
mcphub.io there's even some search engines now which let you find the MCP servers for your use case but for our use case to illustrate the one that we will be using is the service called API so if you just click on their link here which you can also find here in our community you can see that this provides some documentation around API's MCP server and if in case you don't know what API is it's basically a service that integrates a lot of web scrapers so you can see there's one here on Google Maps which we will be using in a bit and a few others around Tik Tok Amazon and a
couple more so once you get to use this you basically will be able to scrape and get a lot of data from different platforms depending on your use case but for our purpose the key thing that we want to understand is how to use this MCP server in N8N so what you just need to do is to find NPX and that will directly take you through this instruction sheet which basically gives you the building block to connect N8N to your MCP server of choice you just need to copy this command called npx into nn here in the command and then also copy the arguments so just copy that in and paste it here but you will just need to
remove the double quotes and a comma there so it's going to be hyphen y and then this piece of text that calls on the API MCP server and then for the environment instead of actually pasting this one just go ahead and go back to our community and copy this piece of text and just so you can see your text just change that to expression and then paste that in and for my testing this sort of format is the one that works and now you were able to feed this MCP connection that we are setting up with the building blocks it needs to make use of the API MCP server so the npx command
basically instructs N8N to execute the MCP servers code which is available in this directory that is being hosted by API and the password that basically lets you access API servers is going to be your API token here which if you go to api.com and just head to go to console once you've signed up you can just head to settings here on the left click on APIs and integrations and you can create a new token here give it a description and click on create and now if you copy that API key you can replace this part
within the brackets into that key that you have and just rename this credential to something like API so that you know that it is connecting to API's MCP server so now if you click on test step and with your operation set as list tools what it basically did there is connect to API's MCP server and N8N asks the server what tools is available in its arsenal and if you just scroll down here there's a couple ones already provided and supported which if you go to schema it's much easier to work through that and if I just collapse some
of these you'll be able to see this specific tool which we'll be using to extract Google Maps data with and again back to our analogy if the MCP server is the recipe book then each of these tools would be the recipe pages where the tool or actions name is given here the description of the recipe is given here and you can see for this given MCP server there are five recipe pages or tools which you can make use of so if you click away that's well and good now the last thing we just want to show before we go and complete our AI agent is just go ahead and add a node and search for MCP again and this time
choose execute a tool and then name this as something like MCP execute tool tester because this is just a good way for you to test yourself how to connect to this MCP server before you instruct your AI agent to do that for you so just go ahead and place that here and you can see it's basically asking for a tool name and tool parameters so this is going to be the name of our recipe in this case and the parameters are going to be the ingredients that we will be providing it so as mentioned before the tool name that we'll be using is this one so if you just head to our community
and copy that in you can just paste that here making sure that letter capitalization and spaces are accounted for and then under tool parameters if you head back to our community and just scroll down to execute tool tester just copy that in change that to expression and then paste that in and now if you look at this it's basically the ingredients that you will be executing this tool with which is the query for the location in this case we'll try out Sydney max crawled places per search is going to be the quantity of listings that we will get and restaurants is our
search string so now before you hit on test step it's just good to install this tool from within your API dashboard first so you can see the runs happening in real time so to do that just go to your API console and then click on API store and then search for that tool in particular so if you search for Google maps it should be one of the very first results there which we of course also link in our community so you can just click on that and it will take you to the tool that we will be using that this service incurs some cost so currently it's at $9 for a,000 results which is
actually good value and not really a blocker for most people hopefully so now if you click on test step here as it executes when you go back to the tool within API and click on runs you should see that there is one run here where we are starting the crawler and this is N8N reaching out to API in order to get some information from Google Maps and now that that is done if we go back to N8N you'll see that it gave us some information here on two restaurants in Sydney which is what we need and now we have validated that we are able to connect to API and execute this tool
using MCP so just go ahead and click away and click this bin icon just to clear out the execution there so now we are ready to provide that tool to our AI agent so just click on tool here on the bottom again search for MCP use this MCP client tool and just rename this to something like MCP Google Maps so this is important because the AI agent actually looks at this name to determine if they need to use this tool or not as well so for the credential to connect with the API credential should appear there for you already and then for tool description you can leave that as to be set automatically and then for the
operation we of course want to execute that tool and then for the tool name again just put in that same tool name as before but now under tool parameters what you want to do is head back to our community page and find this tool parameters for AI agent copy that in change this to expression and then copy that whole piece so if I just expand this just to show what it looks like you can see that it's the same ingredients as before so we're giving it a location query max scroll places per search so these are all as per the tools documentation what it needs in order to run as well as the search string which
is the keyword that we are searching in the previous step we were looking at restaurants and also I just added this one skip closed places so that we skip the places that have already permanently closed but you can see that I have a piece of text here which starts with from AI and this is actually a unique function that N8N has which is quite genius actually because when you use this function you basically let the AI agent define what to put within this area so if for example I ask it for five restaurants in Japan the AI agent can
get the context from that request and put Japan here put five in here because that's the number of restaurants that the user wants and then put the keyword of restaurant here because that's again what the user wants to look for which is pretty neat because that's the AI agent doing its own thinking on how to structure that request so that is well and good click away and now before we test this the other thing that you just want to set up is by double clicking on this AI agent and we want to provide this AI agent a system prompt by clicking on add option and click on system message and again if you head
back in our community you can just copy this whole thing and then change this to expression and copy the whole thing there and now if we expand this piece you can give this a read if you want but this system prompt is going to basically be this AI agent's purpose in life so you can see it's describing what the role of the AI agent is you can see it's describing what are the tools that we will be setting up one is this MCP Google Maps tool which we just did and a couple of other details which I'll go
back to in a bit but for now click away so that we can test it out and click on save so now if we open chat and ask it for something like give me two dentists in New York you can see that it is now going to use the MCP Google Maps tool to get you those two dentists in New York and again if we go back to API you can see that the crawler has been started to get us that information and there you go you can see that it was able to give us two dentists in New York now if it took some time for you like it did with me you can actually double click your AI agent and go to logs here in the output
section and just inspect the logs here to see what could have gone wrong at least for our case and maybe what will happen for you as well is it likely tried repeating the process because it was not yet able to upload information to Google Drive because we haven't set up that yet but that should be okay because that is what we'll be setting up next so just click the bin icon here to remove that instance and now click on tool and set up your Google Drive by clicking on this Google Drive tool and then to set this up you will need a credential to connect with and for you
to do that just click on create new credential and you can see that it is asking for your client ID and client secret here so to get that I actually link here a tutorial from previously which you can just click and that will take you to a one minute tutorial of how to set this up in Google Cloud so that you can get your client ID and client secret so once you have that set up you can just go ahead and sign in with Google and that should connect your account to NATN now for some instances if you are facing this view where it's asking for the authorization URL and
grant types you can just fill in these details which we have also made available in our community page so just click away and now you should have a Google Drive account credential connected here and the only configs you need to change is set the operation as create from text and for the file content you can actually just click on this sparkles icon and that will allow your AI agent to define what to put here automatically which is pretty neat and then for the file name you can just name this with whatever honestly but if you want you can also just copy this piece
in our community and just change this to expression and put it there and what that will basically do is put in today's date as the file name and then this piece is going to be your chat input which you will see in a bit now for this pieces you just need to select the folder where you want to put your files in for my case I point it towards this R27 folder and that's it you have now successfully set up Google Drive so now if you click away click on save and open chat and now we can try something like get free pizza places in New York you
can see that it has provided us with information on those pizza places and have now gave us the CSV file so if you click on that it's properly named with today's date as well as the query that we just gave and if you open that it gave us all the information we need including this lead score a reasoning for that score and a draft email that we can start with to contact this lead and if we go back to API under the runs of that tool that we are calling if you click on that specific run that we did you can see that it also gives you this
URL which is quite neat because with that you can preview the locations of those establishments which you just searched for so if you just click on that it will provide you the results neatly laid out in Google Maps so now just to go back to that system prompt if you double click on the AI agent and just expand the system prompt here it's just important to go through this once so that you can edit it to your liking because as mentioned this early portion is just around giving the agent awareness around the tools that it has access to such as the MCP Google maps
tool as well as the Google Drive tool and then a few critical requirements around the formatting just to make sure that the CSV format is not messed up but you can see here that these columns we are getting them from API and there's actually a few more columns available there but in my analysis these are the ones that are most relevant you can also see here the prompt that is being used to come up with the lead score an example of the reasoning and an example of the draft email and the instructions here are quite important so have a read through them but basically the way that
the agent is analyzing the lead is to see if number one they have a website if they don't have a website then obviously that's a service that you can offer to them as well if they have low reviews then maybe their review management is not up to spec and could use an assist it also checks for image counts so if there's only something like one to three images of their food as a restaurant then you can offer them services in that regard so that they have more photos of their menu if they don't have a lot of
social media presence that's also something that can be provided and lastly their Google business profile which is basically their listing profile in Google Maps this is important because if it's unclaimed that means that they're listed in Google Maps but the owner has never probably seen that and so they probably have never seen the reviews that are available there and so this portion is just the instructions around getting the lead score and the personalized email and there are just a few more formatting prompts here just to
make sure that it is correctly following your instructions you can of course chat to your agent here but if you just switch this to active and open this trigger you can toggle this chat to be publicly available and it will provide you this chat URL which you can click and paste in another window and it will provide you a chat interface that is much easier to work with and which you can even start to provide to your client if you are offering this as a service and there you go you just learned what MCP is what the top three ways to make money with MCP is right now and also
build your very first AI agent that is powered by the model context protocol this is obviously still the beginning and so for sure this will not be the last that we will hear of MCP so if you like this lesson head over to the positive focus discussion category and share what you learned just so that people can be inspired to take this lesson as well see you guys in the next one thank you
